Brief Overview of sphinx tool
=============================

Sphinx is a free open source project written in Python and was indeed, originally created for Python documentation. It has since become a tool that creates elegant documentation for software projects supporting a range of languages. Basically, it takes a bunch of text files written in a language called reStructuredText and renders it (mainly) as HTML. ReStructuredText is a powerful markup language designed specifically for technical documentation.

One of Sphinx’s most attractive features is its extensions—these are simply Python modules—that let you do cool things with your documentation like add Google maps, embed YouTube videos, insert diagrams and so on. Programmers in particular seem to love Sphinx because it actually makes them want to document their code—apparently writing documentation is as exciting for them as getting a root canal (weirdos).
